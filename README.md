**[Project Topic:]**
-This project aims to build a system that automates workshop check-in in the EXLAB.
**[Problem Statement:]**
-Currently, students credentials are manually entered when checking in for workshops. In fact, EXLAB staff has to physically type all information from the card into the system in order to complete the registration process. Our project aims to automate this process, shortening the time it takes for students to enroll.
**[Requirements:]**
-There are two parts of requirements user requriements and system requrirments. User requirements are statements written in a natural language. On the other hand, system requriments provide more specific information and functions of system.
**[User requirements:]**
-The proposed system must automate the workshop check-in system, increasing the efficiency and speed for the registration of students to scheduled workshops in the EXLAB.
**[System requirements:]**
-For example: Can store both the ID and the survey associated with it in one listing of the database.
**[System modeling(Analysis):]**
-We use use Architecture modelling, behavioral modeling(included sequence diagram), case diagram, , class diagram to analysis the system that we are going to build.
**[Implementation:]**
-We use Java language and Mongodatabase to implement our project and use JUnit to test our program.
